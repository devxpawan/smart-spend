# Fingerprint Login Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to use the fingerprint login feature implemented with WebAuthn in the SmartSpend application.

## How It Works

The fingerprint login feature uses the WebAuthn API to enable passwordless authentication using biometric data (fingerprint, face recognition, etc.) or device PIN.

### Registration Process

1. User enables fingerprint login in their profile settings
2. The browser generates a public-private key pair using the device's secure enclave
3. The private key is securely stored in the device hardware
4. The public key is sent to the server and associated with the user account

### Authentication Process

1. User selects "Login with Fingerprint" on the login page
2. The browser requests the user to authenticate using their biometric method
3. The device signs a challenge with the private key
4. The signed data is sent to the server for verification
5. If verified, the server generates a JWT token and logs the user in

## Browser Support

The feature works with modern browsers that support WebAuthn:
- Chrome 67+
- Edge 18+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 13+

## Device Requirements

- A device with a fingerprint reader, Face ID, or other biometric sensor
- Or a device with a secure PIN entry system

## Setup Instructions

### For Users

1. Log in to your account
2. Go to Profile Settings
3. Click "Enable Fingerprint Login"
4. Follow your browser's prompts to register your biometric data
5. Next time you log in, you can use the "Login with Fingerprint" option

### For Developers

1. The WebAuthn implementation uses the `@simplewebauthn` libraries:
   - `@simplewebauthn/browser` for the frontend
   - `@simplewebauthn/server` for the backend

2. Key files:
   - Frontend: `client/src/contexts/WebAuthnContext.tsx`
   - Backend: `server/routes/webauthn.js`
   - User model: `server/models/User.js` (with webauthnCredentials field)

3. Routes:
   - `GET /api/webauthn/register-options` - Get registration options
   - `POST /api/webauthn/register` - Register a new credential
   - `GET /api/webauthn/login-options` - Get authentication options
   - `POST /api/webauthn/login` - Authenticate with a credential

## Security Notes

- Biometric data never leaves the user's device
- Private keys are stored securely in device hardware
- All communication happens over HTTPS
- The server only stores public keys
- Challenge-response mechanism prevents replay attacks

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you're using a supported browser
2. Check that your device has biometric capabilities
3. Make sure you're accessing the site over HTTPS (in production)
4. Clear your browser cache and try again

For development, you can test with localhost over HTTP.
